The report has presented semi-supervised locally linear 
embedding in the broader context of local graph-based manifold learning and 
examined its performance in a variety of experimental settings.
An open-source \texttt{R} implementation of SSLLE has emerged as a side 
product of this work.

The resulting insights beg further research questions.
One issue the report has omitted is, for instance, computational complexity.
A thorough benchmark study would surely contribute to a more in-depth assessment 
of which technique is preferable under which conditions.
Beyond that, two aspects seem particularly appealing.
First, the methods discussed provide embeddings for a given set of training 
data, but it is not immediately clear how they generalize to new
observations without computing the entire embedding anew.
\citet{bengioetal2003} proposed out-of-sample extensions for LGML models using 
kernels, which was also a reason for placing LGML in the framework of KPCA.
With this and perhaps some more modern techniques in mind, it would be 
interesting to study a generative version of SSLLE.
In turn, the key idea of SSLLE might be a valuable extension to other 
learners.
Conceivably, some applications offer the opportunity to gain prior knowledge.
The notion of semi-supervision \citet{yangetal2006} have introduced for SSLLE 
could be similarly supportive in other unsupervised algorithms that are not yet 
able to draw on the information of labeled instances.
All in all, there is certainly no lack of research opportunities in the field 
of manifold learning, and the developments of recent years suggest 
dimensionality reduction and representation learning might remain hot topics 
for the foreseeable future.
