\begin{itemize}
  \item Why is dimensionality reduction desirable? Not only because it's easier 
  to handle and visualize lower-dimensional data but because data-generating 
  process is often truly of much lower dimension
  \item Our goal is to find the mapping from latent feature space embedded in 
  the m-dimensional Euclidean space we observe to the d-dimensional space the
  embedding is locally homeomorphic to (unrolling the Swiss roll)
  \item This mapping can be constructed linearly or non-linearly (slapping the 
  roll flat vs unrolling it), thereby defining the complexity of the manifolds 
  we are able to learn
  \item Give brief intuition to manifold learning: what do we mean by 
  topologies, manifolds, maps, charts?
  \item What methods are already out there? \textcolor{red}{BRIEF - only to
  give some framework to place presented methods in}
\end{itemize}
