The report has presented the technique of semi-supervised locally linear 
embedding in the broader context of local graph-based manifold learning and 
examined its performance in a variety of experimental settings.
An open-source implementation of SSLLE in \texttt{R} has emerged as a side 
product of this work.

The resulting insights beg further research questions.
One issue the report has omitted is computational complexity.
A thorough benchmark study would surely contribute to a more in-depth assessment 
of which technique is preferable under which conditions.
Beyond that, two aspects seem particularly appealing.
First, the methods discussed provide embeddings for a given set of training 
data, but it is not immediately clear how they generalize to new
observations without computing the entire embedding anew.
\citet{bengioetal2003} proposed out-of-sample extensions for LGML models using 
kernels, which was also a reason for placing LGML in the framework of KPCA.
However, with more modern techniques in mind, it would certainly be 
interesting to study a generative version of SSLLE.
In turn, the key idea of SSLLE might be a valuable extension to other 
learners.
Conceivably, some applications offer the opportunity to obtain prior information 
at low cost.
The notion of semi-supervision \citet{yangetal2006} have introduced for SSLLE 
could be similarly supportive in other unsupervised algorithms that are of yet 
not able to incorporate labeled instances.

All in all, there is undoubtedly no lack of research opportunities in the field 
of manifold learning, and the developments of recent years suggest 
dimensionality reduction and representation learning might remain hot topics 
for the foreseeable future.
