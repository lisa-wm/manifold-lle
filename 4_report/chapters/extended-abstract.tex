The goal of this report is to lay out the theoretical framework behind the 
manifold learning technique of \textit{semi-supervised locally linear embedding 
(SS-LLE)}, and to put it to implementation for data sampled from a manifold.

Proposed by \citet{yangetal2006}, SS-LLE extends the local graph-based method 
of \textit{locally linear embedding (LLE)} that had earlier been developed by 
\citet{roweissaul2000} and seen widespread application ever since.
