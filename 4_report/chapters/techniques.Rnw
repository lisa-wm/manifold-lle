\subsubsection{Laplacian Eigenmaps (LEM)}
\label{laplace}

The reason for LEM to appear in this report alongside the LLE family is its 
underlying theory both providing a foundation for LLE \citep{belkinniyogi2003}, 
which was originally proposed lacking such, and closely related to the 
theoretical concepts in HLLE \citep{donohogrimes2003}.

LEM are centered around the preservation of locality, i.e., mapping nearby 
inputs to nearby outputs.
Locality is enforced via the \textit{Laplace-Beltrami operator} defined on 
smooth, compact manifolds and operationalized by means of the \textit{graph Laplacian} acting as a discrete approximator \citep{belkinniyogi2003}.
This idea is best understood recalling that the similarity of outputs for 
similar inputs is essentially a notion of smoothness and can thus be controlled 
by a size constraint on the gradient of the mapping function.
\\

Consider the twice differentiable function $f: \mani \rightarrow \R$ mapping 
two points $\pv, \qv \in \mani$ to $f(\pv)$ and $f(\qv)$, respectively. 
On $\mani$ they are connected by a length-parametrized curve $c(t)$.
Denote the geodesic distance between $\pv$ and $\qv$ by $\ell$, such that
$\pv = c(0)$ and $\qv = c(\ell)$.

\begin{minipage}[b]{0.65\textwidth}
  Gradients of $f$ with respect to $\pv$ are defined in the local tangent space
  $T_{\pv}(\mani)$ spanned by vectors tangent to $\mani$ at $\pv$.
  As $\mani$ is embedded in $\RD$, its tangent spaces are again Euclidean and of 
  dimension $d$, i.e., $d$-dimensional hyperplanes as depicted in figure 
  \ref{fig:sphere-tangent} \citep{sudderth2002}.
  If $\pv$ is identified with the origin of $T_{\pv}(\mani)$, the tangent space
  inherits an orthonormal coordinate system obtained from endowing
  $T_{\pv}(\mani)$ with the inner product from $\Rd$ \citep{donohogrimes2003}.
  With this, the distance $|f(\pv) - f(\qv)|$ of mappings can be expressed as
  the length of the integral
  $\int_0^{\ell} \langle \nabla f(c(t)), c^{\prime}(t) \rangle dt$.
  In other words, the geodesic curve connecting $\pv$ and $\qv$ is projected onto
  $T_{\pv}(\mani)$, and the length of this projection depends on the gradient of 
  $f$ and the curve velocity.

    manifold, embedded in $\R^3$. \textit{Source:} own representation.}

  \end{figure}
\end{minipage}

Exploiting the Schwartz equality and relations proved in 
\citet{belkinniyogi2008}, it
can be shown that 
$|f(\pv) - f(\qv)| \leq \| \nabla f(\pv) \| \cdot \| \pv - \qv\| + o$.
Acknowledging the fact that the distance between $\pv$ and $\qv$ is a datum,
$\| \nabla f \|$ controls how far apart points are mapped on the real line.
Consequently, the goal is to find a mapping that, on average, preserves 
locality by minimizing $\int_{\mani}\| \nabla f \|^2$.
This is just equal to minimizing $\int_{\mani} \mathcal{L}(f)f$ with 
$\mathcal{L}$ the Laplace-Beltrami operator.
The optimal embedding map is then given by the $d$ principal eigenfunctions of
$\mathcal{L}$ \citep{belkinniyogi2003}.
\\

Now the same reasoning can be applied to the neighborhood graph approximation of
$\mani$.

  \item How will that help?

\subsubsection{Finding Prior Points}
\label{prior-points}

Prior points: take minmax approach from sparse MDS (Sparse multidimensional 
scaling using landmark points Vin de Silva and Joshua B. Tenenbaum 2004). 
Easy and deterministic after choosing seed value.
Instead Euclidean distances, though, take geodesics as estimated in isomap.

can we view the prior info as some kind of active learning? like we choose 
some points to label in a hopefully cleverish way and then hand them to you 
(e.g., to look at some pictures instead of all droelf thousand)

\subsection{Particular Challenges}
\label{challenges}

A number of computational and design-related challenges arise from this 
procedure that must be faced in implementation.
\\

\textbf{Choice of intrinsic dimensionality.} 
Until now, it has been assumed, rather implicitly, that the intrinsic dimension 
$d$ of the data is a known parameter.
This is obviously not always the case in practical applications.
Some methods offer the advantage of estimating $d$ in a built-in fashion. 
PCA, MDS and Isomap, for instance, typically show an indicative gap in their 
eigenvalue spectrum, distinctly pointing out the dimensions with the largest 
share of variability \citep{sauletal2006}.
For LLE, LEM and HLLE, no such tell-tale gap exists.
While \citet{shasaul2005} have indeed drawn a mathematical relation between the 
respective eigenspectra in LLE and LEM and intrinsic data dimensionality, they 
immediately discarded this finding for practical applications due to large 
computational overhead and lack of reliability in finite-sample situations.
There have been various other proposals to tackle the problem of dimensionality 
estimation (for an extensive discussion, see for example 
\citet{disswissel2017}).
However, as the focus of this report lies on a semi-supervised method of 
manifold learning, it is mainly concerned with situations where prior knowledge 
of coordinates, and of $d$ in particular, is actually available.
\\

\textbf{Choice of neighborhood size.} Choosing the size of neighborhoods for 
graph approximation does pose a challenge.
It is a standard hyperparameter optimization problem in which a trade-off 
between locality and overall approximation must be balanced.
If neighborhoods are too small, the model will not be able to learn the global 
manifold structure; with overly large neighborhoods, it will forgo the 
advantages of locality and non-linearity and essentially behave like PCA 
\citep{deridderduin2002}.

Unsupervised RF works with simulating new data from the estimated dist of the 
present ones, see e.g. https://horvath.genetics.ucla.edu/html/RFclustering/RFclustering/RandomForestHorvath.pdf, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.02121.pdf}
